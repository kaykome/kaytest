## Practice Github
* create an empty file on git using the touch command and an argument which is the name of the file.
* ls command to list the files
* cp the file into the directory you want the file to be
* go to github navigate to that directory and create a new file with same name as the one you created on git bash
* go back to git and initiate the "git add ." command : this will add all new files
* now you can go back to git to edit the new file you just added.


## This is the second day of my practice.
